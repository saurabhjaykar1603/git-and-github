    <h1>Introduction to Git & GitHub</h1>

    <h2>Git</h2>
    <p>Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and
        manage your codebase. It helps you keep a record of who made changes, when they were made, and why they were
        made.</p>

    <h2>GitHub</h2>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based hosting platform designed for developers. It provides a centralized location to store your
        code repositories and enables collaboration among team members. GitHub supports projects in various programming
        languages and allows others to review and contribute to your code. It is a free and open-source platform, making
        it widely used and popular among developers.</p>
